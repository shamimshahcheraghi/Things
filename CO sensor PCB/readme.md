This is PCB files for our CO gas detection sensor.

The sensor can be calibrated either for danger level alarm or precise CO level in ppms.
This work has been done with *Altium Designer 2016*.

I should sincerely thank **Mr.Sepehr Hashtroudi** for his contributions in the design and test procedure.

You can contact me via me@mhtb.ir in case you have questions.
