## Introduction
### Thing
A thing, in the context of the Internet of things (IoT),
is an entity or physical object that has a unique identifier,
an embedded system and the ability to transfer data over a network.

### nRF
The nRF24L01 is a highly integrated, ultra low power (ULP)
2Mbps RF transceiver IC for the 2.4GHz ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band.
With peak RX/TX currents lower than 14mA, a sub Î¼A power down mode,
advanced power management, and a 1.9 to 3.6V supply range,
the nRF24L01 provides a true ULP solution enabling months to years
of battery lifetime when running on coin cells or AA/AAA batteries.
